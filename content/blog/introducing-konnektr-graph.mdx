## The problem we kept running into

If you've tried to build **digital twins** in a real enterprise environment, you've probably felt this tension:

- You want a **graph database** because the world is connected: assets, locations, processes, sensors, people, constraints.
- You want **operational boring** because this is infrastructure: backups, monitoring, HA, permissions, audits.
- You want to avoid **vendor lock-in**, because “core system of record” and “can't migrate” shouldn't be in the same sentence.
- You want data that's actually usable for **AI agents**: not a pile of unvalidated strings, but structured context that stays consistent over time.

And yet, the options often force trade-offs:

- Managed graph offerings can be great, but the moment your solution becomes critical, pricing and portability start to matter.
- General-purpose graph engines sometimes come with new operational surfaces, new query languages, and new reliability concerns.
- "AI memory" systems are frequently built on top of documents alone, which can be fine—until you need guarantees like *model validation*, *relationships*, and *governance*.

We built Konnektr because we kept wanting the same thing: an open, reliable foundation for digital twin systems, without turning every project into a long-term platform bet.

## The journey (and the “why” behind it)

Konnektr didn't start as a “let's build a company” idea. It started as a recurring pattern we saw while working with digital twin projects: the moment you go from a proof-of-concept to production, the requirements get serious.

You need:

- A **model** (and a language to express it) so your team can agree on what a “Pump” or “Station” means.
- A **graph** so you can traverse from one part of the system to another (and answer questions you didn't anticipate on day one).
- A **platform** you can run for years, where upgrades and outages don't feel like existential risks.

We spent a lot of time with the Azure Digital Twins ecosystem: DTDL models, the API surface, and the official SDKs. And while that experience was productive, it also highlighted a gap:

> Many teams want the Azure Digital Twins developer experience, but they also want control: open source, portability, and predictable operations.

So we decided to build Konnektr in the open—starting with the piece that everything else depends on: the graph.

## What we built: Konnektr Graph

Today we're launching **Konnektr Graph**, our flagship product and the first major building block of the Konnektr platform.

Konnektr Graph is a **semantic property graph** database that:

- Runs on **PostgreSQL** with **Apache AGE** for graph capabilities
- Is **Azure Digital Twins API compatible**, so you can use the official Azure SDKs
- Has **DTDL** model validation built in (because model drift is real)
- Supports “read for AI agents” workflows via **hybrid vector + graph search**
- Deploys in minutes as a managed service or as a self-hosted database
- Uses **Apache 2.0** licensing and is fully open source

If you've ever wished you could keep the same digital twin programming model while simplifying operations and keeping portability, this is for you.

## Why PostgreSQL + Apache AGE?

This was a deliberate choice, and it's central to how we think about infrastructure.

### PostgreSQL is the “boring” we want

PostgreSQL has earned its place in production stacks for a reason:

- Reliability and durability are proven.
- Your team already has tooling: migrations, backups, monitoring, observability, access control.
- Your platform team can operate it without learning a brand new operational playbook.

For infrastructure-critical systems—like digital twin platforms—**open source is non-negotiable**. PostgreSQL is one of the best examples of what open source looks like when it's trusted at the highest levels.

### Extensions are a superpower, not a hack

Digital twins rarely live alone. You often want the graph plus:

- **pgvector** for AI embeddings and similarity search
- **PostGIS** for spatial data (assets on a map, routes, zones, proximity)
- Mature Postgres features: indexing, partitioning, roles, RLS, logical replication

By building on Postgres, you can evolve your stack without replacing it.

### Apache AGE gives us a property graph on Postgres

Apache AGE adds property graph capabilities (nodes, edges, properties) as a Postgres extension. That matters because it keeps the “center of gravity” where most teams are already comfortable: PostgreSQL.

We're intentionally focusing on a pragmatic sweet spot:

- A property graph you can traverse and query efficiently
- Without moving your data into a separate specialized system
- While preserving the operational maturity of Postgres

## Why Azure Digital Twins API compatibility?

It's simple: we want developers to ship.

The Azure Digital Twins API and SDKs are a well-known interface for building digital twin applications. A lot of teams have already written code around these clients, patterns, and models.

Konnektr Graph is designed to be a **drop-in replacement** at the API level:

- Use the official Azure SDKs for .NET, Python, and JavaScript
- Keep your existing integration patterns
- Typically, you only change configuration (like the service endpoint), not your application logic

This also keeps the ecosystem approachable: you can onboard engineers faster, and you don't need to introduce an “exotic query language” as your primary API contract.

## Model validation matters (especially for AI)

A lot of systems look fine until you ask them to scale across teams.

Without validation, digital twin graphs slowly accumulate inconsistencies:

- Missing required properties
- Twins created with the wrong model
- Relationships that violate your domain rules
- “Temporary” fields that become permanent

DTDL-based validation gives you a way to keep a shared language between teams and tools—and it makes downstream use (including AI agent workflows) much more trustworthy.

We're building Konnektr Graph to be a place where you can store context and still have confidence in it months later.

## Who Konnektr Graph is for

We built Konnektr Graph for developers and technical decision-makers who want a solid foundation for connected data.

Some of the use cases we're targeting from day one:

- **Digital twin infrastructure**: water networks, traffic systems, rail, smart cities
- **IoT platforms**: device hierarchies, telemetry relationships, dependency graphs
- **AI agent knowledge bases**: structured semantic context without the complexity of RDF-heavy stacks
- **Complex business relationships**: org charts, supply chains, project dependencies, ownership and responsibility graphs

If you need to answer questions like “what is impacted if this asset fails?” or “what does this sensor influence?” or “what should an agent consider before taking action?”, a semantic property graph is a strong fit.

## Operational simplicity (because you'll run this for years)

Konnektr Graph is meant to feel like a Postgres workload:

- Standard PostgreSQL operations for backups and restores
- Familiar monitoring and metrics pipelines
- A clear path to production hardening (roles, permissions, HA patterns)

You shouldn't have to choose between “graph” and “operational sanity.”

## How to try it today

You can get started in a few different ways:

- Deploy Konnektr Graph (managed): https://ktrlplane.konnektr.io/resources/create?resource_type=Konnektr.Graph
- Product page: https://konnektr.io/graph
- Documentation: https://docs.konnektr.io
- GitHub (source + issues): https://github.com/konnektr-io/pg-age-digitaltwins

We also offer a simple pricing model for managed hosting:

- Free tier: **500 twins**
- Standard tier: **$99/month** for **1M twins**

Self-hosting is always free.

## Trade-offs and what's still evolving

This is a launch, not a finish line.

Building a semantic property graph on PostgreSQL + Apache AGE is powerful, but it comes with real engineering work:

- Some workloads need careful indexing and query tuning (as they do in Postgres generally).
- Compatibility is a journey: we're prioritizing the core Azure Digital Twins API surface and expanding coverage based on real user needs.
- Hybrid search for AI agents is evolving fast; we're building the primitives, and we expect the community to help shape what “good” looks like in practice.

Our promise is not "everything on day one." Our promise is openness, a strong foundation, and steady progress—made in public.

## What's next for Konnektr

Konnektr Graph is the first product in a broader open-source platform we're building:

- **Assembler** — an AI-powered digital twin builder
- **Flow** — real-time data and event orchestration
- **Compass** — analytics and insights for digital twin systems

The goal is a cohesive toolbox where you can go from “we have assets and telemetry” to “we have a governed twin graph and intelligent automation” without stitching together a dozen proprietary components.
